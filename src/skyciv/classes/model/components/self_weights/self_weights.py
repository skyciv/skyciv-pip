        Args:

            x (int, optional): Acceleration due to gravity in the x-axis, defined as a multiplier of the gravitational constant g. Defaults to 0.

            LG (str, optional): The load group that the self-weight belongs to. Defaults to existing value. Defaults to 'SW1'.

        Example:
