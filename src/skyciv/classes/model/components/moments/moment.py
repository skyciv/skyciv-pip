        Args:
            type (str): The type of object to which the load is applied. node, member. {"n" | "m"}.
            node (int, optional): The node ID which the moment is located. If type is "m", provide value None. Defaults to None.
            member (int, optional): The member ID which the moment is located. If type is "n", provide value None. Defaults to None.
            position (float, optional): The percentage from node_A to node_B of the member which the moment is located. E.g. 10 for 10 %. If type is "n", provide value None. Defaults to None.
            x_mag (float, optional): The magnitude of the moment about the x-axis. Positive = counter-clockwise, negative = clockwise. Defaults to 0.
            y_mag (float, optional): The magnitude of the moment about the y-axis. Positive = counter-clockwise, negative = clockwise. Defaults to 0.
            z_mag (float, optional): The magnitude of the moment about the z-axis. Positive = counter-clockwise, negative = clockwise. Defaults to 0.
            load_group (str, optional): The load group to which the moment will be grouped. Defaults to None.
