        Args:
            node_A (int): The ID of the start node.
            node_B (int): The ID of the end node.
            section_id (int): The ID of the section that should be applied to the member.
            fixity_A (str, optional): See docs for restraint code https://skyciv.com/api/v3/docs/s3d-model#restraint-code. Defaults to 'FFFFFF'.
            fixity_B (str, optional): See docs for restraint code https://skyciv.com/api/v3/docs/s3d-model#restraint-code. Defaults to 'FFFFFF'.
            type (str, optional): Defaults to 'normal'. {"normal" | "normal_continuous" | "cable" | "rigid"}.
            cable_length (float, optional): Required only when type = cable. Defaults to None.
            rotation_angle (float, optional): Rotation of the member about its own axis, in degrees.
            offset_Ax (float, optional): The local x distance that the member is offset from its centroid at node A.
            offset_Ay (float, optional): The local y distance that the member is offset from its centroid at node A.
            offset_Az (float, optional): The local z distance that the member is offset from its centroid at node A.
            offset_Bx (float, optional): The local x distance that the member is offset from its centroid at node B.
            offset_By (float, optional): The local y distance that the member is offset from its centroid at node B.
            offset_Bz (float, optional): The local z distance that the member is offset from its centroid at node B.
